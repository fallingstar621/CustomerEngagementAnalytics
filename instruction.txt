The input conversation data to start with should be a csv file where each row is an utterance with the following fields:

conversation_id: the id of the conversation where the utterance belongs
speaker_name: the speaker's name of the utterance
speaker_type: agent/customer
text: the text of the utterance
utterance_id: the sequential turn of the utterance in the conversation (starts from 1)

You can find a sample csv file 'input_sample.csv' under the public/data folder.
