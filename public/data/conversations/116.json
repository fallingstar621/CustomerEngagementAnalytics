Screenshots attached. URL\nOne is #OVX Book PrOVX Book 2: URL and the other is #OVX Book 2. :) \nSo there's OVX Book PrOVX Book 2, OVX Book 2 and OVX Book 2 Drive. Can u rec a forum or blog post showing what all 3 are and how they work together?\n#OVX Book 2Drive is a part of #OVX Book 2. #OVX Book PrOVX Book 2 is an app: URL I will when I get a chance. :) \nback on the website(s)...Is this it? OVX Book 2 = project collaboration vs. OVX Book PrOVX Book 2 = cloud drawing + collaboration?\nYour files will show in both, but #OVX Book PrOVX Book 2 is just for Tabletop drawing, while #OVX Book 2 is for pretty much all files.\nYou will also see some interface differences. #OVX Book PrOVX Book 2 will allow you to create and edit drawings. \nand what have you heard about which one works better for OVX Book PrOVX Book 2 - iPad Pro versus Surface Pro?\nThis would be a good one for the #OVX Book PrOVX Book 2 board: URL \nURL\nThe forum is monitored by our #Tabletop experts who will be able to help you. We will follow up for you after you post it. \ngot it. Thanks. That's encouraging ;)\nYou're welcome! :) \nGot this after sending an email reply to the introductory OVX Book 2 sign up email... better. :) URL\nGlad you received the information you were looking for. Please let us know if you have some more questions :) \nwould still like more guidance on how OVX Book 2/OVX Book 2Drive/OVX Book PrOVX Book 2 all work together, and how all 3 work CAN work with Office365.\nHave you visited the forum and posted your questions, I have found a post that may be helpful. :)  URL\nhaha. That's my forum post!\nWe have a specialist responding to your post right now, take a look. :) \ncorresponding with him.
