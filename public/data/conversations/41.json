Really unhappy!\nYikes, our sincere apologies for that. Could we get your case number, so we can verify everything on your account?\nsure it was Order #36897295000\nAs for fixing my problem they haven't. I just checked my account and the subscription remains with auto renew on.\nOk got it. We've already cancelled the auto renewal of your #Halo Desktop subscription and it will expire on 28/1/2017. (1/2)\nIt's still showing auto renew in your account due to the system design, which allows you to turn back on the renewal. (2/2)\nWe aplogize for the conTabletop Pro and the experience you've had! But rest assured that your auto renewal has been cancelled. \nThanks. As for the account design. When are you guys fixing it. I don't like having to call your helpdesk to make changes.\nYou're welcome. Thanks for the feedback, we can only cope with it at the moment since the purchase still goes through (1/2)\nDigital River.

Apparently they can't call me and want me to call your help desk instead.\nThis is to do with the complaint about their staff calling me at 4:45am in the morning.\nI will indicate it in case 12535482. You can also reopen the case simply by replying to the email, which you received. \nI want a manager to call me back today during business hours.
